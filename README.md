About Project :

CM_Tool is a code complexity measuring tool.It allows to upload and measure the complexity of a single, zip and unzip files. CM_Tool measures the code complexity of a software due 6 factors. They are:

              01. Size Factor
              02. Variables Factor
              03. Methods Factor
              04. Inheritance Factor
              05. Control Structure Factor
              06. Coupling Factor
              
01.Size Factor

       * Size factor measures the code complexity of a software based on some program components such as number of keywords, number of   identifiers, number of operators, number of numerical values and number of string literals accordingly.
        
       * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
       
       * The complexities of the files are shown in a ' tabular ' format.
       
       * This function allows the user to print the results of complexity due to size as a CSV file.
