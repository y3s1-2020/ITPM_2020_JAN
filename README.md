About Project :

CM_Tool is a code complexity measuring tool.It allows to upload and measure the complexity of a single, zip and unzip files. It measure the code complexity for programs in JAVA language for all factora and c++ language for inheritance facotr. CM_Tool measures the code complexity of a software due 6 factors. They are:

              01. Size Factor
              02. Variables Factor
              03. Methods Factor
              04. Inheritance Factor
              05. Control Structure Factor
              06. Coupling Factor
              
01.Size Factor

       * Size factor measures the code complexity of a software based on some program components such as number of keywords, number of   identifiers, number of operators, number of numerical values and number of string literals accordingly.
        
       * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
       
       * The complexities of the files are shown in a ' tabular ' format.
       
       * This function allows the user to print the results of complexity due to size as a CSV file.

02. Variables Factor

        * Variables factor measures the code complexity of a software based on some program components such as 'global variables', 'local variables', 'variables with primitive data types', 'variables with composite variables'.
       
        * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
       
        * The complexities of the files are shown in a ' tabular ' format.
        
        * This function allows the user to print the results of complexity due to variables as a CSV file.

03. Methods Factor

        * Methods factor measures the code complexity of a software based on some program components such as 'method return type' amd 'method parameter type'
        
         * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
         
        * This function allows the user to print the results of complexity due to variables as a CSV file.

04. Inheritance

        * Inheritance factor measures the code complexity of a software based on program components such as 'direct inheritances' and 'indirect inheritances'.
        
        * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
        
        *This function measures code complexity for programs in JAVA and C++ both.

05. Control Structures

        * Control Strucutres factor measures the code complexity of a software based on program components such as 'available control structures' and 'number of conditions in control structures'.
        
        * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
         
        * This function allows the user to print the results of complexity due to variables as a CSV file.


06. Coupling

        * Coupling factor measures the code complexity of a software based on program componts such as 'recursive calls', 'regular methods', 'recursive methods'
        
        * Each program component carries a defaultly set weight, which is also allowed to be changed by the user as they wish by giving   keyboard inputs for the weights.
        
        *
